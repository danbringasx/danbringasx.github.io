<h1>Amazing Dogs</h1>
	<p>We know they're complex animals and are about as versatile as any creature on earth. On top of that, they, along with the domesticated house cat, make the most wonderful, loving, entertaining and companionable pets on this earth! </p>

<p>Dogs are the eyes and ears for the blind and deaf. They are therapy for the shut-ins and disabled and can be a best buddy for a ten year old. Dogs will comfort and soothe an elderly widow or pull sleds loaded with medicine through snow and ice. They perform search and rescue when avalanches bury people and towns and can hunt and track lost hikers, locate missing bodies and find babies buried in the rubble of fallen buildings. Dogs can sniff out illegal drugs and bombs buried in hiding places.</p>
		<p>They track the worst of criminals and help fight wars as well as guarding you, your kids and your property to the death.
  Dogs will bring joy and companionship to a family, even when the family consists of only one lonely person. They are a status symbol to royalty or they can make you smile when you’re totally down and out. They don’t care what color your skin is or what language you speak or what country you live in. Dogs don’t even care if you/re flat broke or have a trillion dollars. They don’t care if your name is Bill Gates or Earl the “homeless guy in the alley behind the bar.” They will stand by them all to the end. Long live man's best friend! That's what a dog is. </p>

	<h1>REASONS WHY I LOVE DOGS</h1>
	  <h1>1.They always want to cuddle.</h1>
    <img src="img/1.JPG" width="450" height="300" alt=""/> </div>
	<P> Want to take a nap? Need a moment of comfort?No matter the reason, dogs are the perfect cuddle-buddy. They will keep you warm and always make you feel safe during your cuddle session.</P>
	<h1>2.Without fail, they are always the first to comfort you. </h1>
<img src="img/2.jpg" width="500" height="431" alt=""/> 
<p>Dogs seem to always be the first ones to notice when you are having a bad day. With the right cute face and licking of the hand, they are continuously able to make you feel better. </p>
<h1>3.No one is more excited to see you when you come home</h1>
<img src="img/3.jpg" width="480" height="360" alt=""/>
	<p>Whether it be when you just wake up, or when you come home for the night, dogs are the first to greet you and are overjoyed to see you. They seem to have a knack for making you feel special and loved. </p>
	<h1>4.They are the most reliable protectors. </h1>
	<img src="img/4.jpg" width="236" height="262" alt=""/>
	<p>There is no one that I trust more than a protective dog. They always have your back and will never let you down. The safest place to be is behind a loyal, protective dog. </p>
	<h1>5.Since they need to be walked daily, they keep you in shape. </h1>
	<img src="img/5.jpg" width="236" height="262" alt=""/> 
	<p>If you are anything like me, exercise tends to be the last thing on your to do list. I usually don't get around to it. Having a dog forces me to get off my lazy butt and take a walk. </p>
	<h1>6.They will never judge or criticize you. </h1>
	<img src="img/6.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt=""/> 
	<p>As the loving creatures they are, dogs will never judge us for our mistakes. </p>
	<h1>7.You always know to not trust someone your dog doesn't like. </h1>
	<img src="img/7.jpg" width="640" height="920" alt=""/>
	<p>Just because people aren't the best judges of character sometimes doesn't mean that dogs are the same way. If your dog does not like someone, always trust them because a dog's instincts are never wrong. </p>
	<h1>8. Once you see their puppy dog face, you can't be mad at them anymore. </h1>
	<img src="img/8.jpeg" width="259" height="194" alt=""/> 
	<p>As much as we love these furry friends, they can be little trouble makers at times. Once they pull out their adorable puppy dog face, we are all doomed. There is no mess they can make that we won't forgive because they are just so cute. </p>
	<h1> 9. You'll never be lonely with a cute dog around.</h1>
	<img src="img/9.jpg" width="400" height="330" alt=""/> 
	<p> They never allow you to feel lonely. Between wanting to play, cuddle, and just wanting to be around us, dogs always make us feel loved and happy.</p>
	<h1>10. They truly are a person's best friend. </h1>
	<img src="img/10.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt=""/>
  <p>There is no one that I love more than my dog. Dogs are loyal to the bone and will always do anything to make us happy. My dog Roxy is my best friend, and I hope everyone else has a friend like a dog to love as well. </p>
